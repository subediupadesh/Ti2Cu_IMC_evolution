# Phase Field Method for Description of Ti2Cu (IMC) evolution in Ti-rich HCP Matrix
The initial nucleation geometries  of the IMC precipitates dictate the final morphologies.
So, the current codes are categorized basically into the following two types:
a. symmetrical initial nucleates (Refer Fig. 6(a) of the paper)
b. asymmetrical initial nucleates (Refer Fig. 6(b) of the paper)
