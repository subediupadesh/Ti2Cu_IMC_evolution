# Phase Field Method for Describing the Morphological Evolution of  Ti2Cu (IMC) Precipitates in Ti-rich HCP Matrix
The initial nucleation geometries  of the IMC precipitates dictate the final morphologies.
So, the current codes are categorized basically into the following two types:

a. symmetrical initial nucleates (Refer Fig. 6(a) of the paper)

b. asymmetrical initial nucleates (Refer Fig. 6(b) of the paper)

This app has been utilized along with the curves of Fig. 4(d) of the paper.
